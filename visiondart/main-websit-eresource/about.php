                <p class="aboutpara">Pligg was created as a social networking CMS. While most
                content management systems are designed for only a handful of
                authors, Pligg CMS was designed to manage a site with an
                unlimited number of authors. All of these registered users are
                in control of the website's content. It is a user driven CMS
                that relies on independent authors' content and participation
                to manage news articles. Pligg started as a simple CMS to let
                users submit and vote on news articles, and that's still what
                we do best. Vote on stories that interest you and articles that
                receive enough votes will appear on the homepage of your Pligg
                site. Pligg offers a 5 star method for voting or the more
                traditional numbered voting as seen on sites like Digg, Mixx,
                or Reddit.</p>
